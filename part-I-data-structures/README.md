# Part I: Data Structures

This repository contains my solutions to the Data Structure Challenges presented in the book "Daily Coding Problem" by Alex Miller and Lawrence Wu. Specifically, it focuses on solutions related to Arrays, Strings, Trees, Graphs, and Hash Tables. All solutions are implemented in Python.
