# Smallest Window to be Sorted

Given an array of integers, find the smallest window that needs to be sorted in order for the entire array to be sorted.

## Examples

### Example 1

Input: `[3, 7, 5, 6, 9]`

Output: `[1, 3]`

Explanation: The smallest window that needs to be sorted is [5, 6, 9], which starts at index 1 and ends at index 3.

### Example 2

Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

Output: `[0, 0]`

Explanation: The array is already sorted, so no window needs to be sorted.

### Example 3

Input: `[1, 3, 2, 4, 5]`

Output: `[1, 1]`

Explanation: The smallest window that needs to be sorted is [3, 2], which starts at index 1 and ends at index 2.
