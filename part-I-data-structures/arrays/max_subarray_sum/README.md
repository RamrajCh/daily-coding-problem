# Calculate Maximum Subarray Sum
Given an array of integers, find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum.

## Examples

Input: `[-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`

Output: `6`

Explanation: `[4,-1,2,1]` has the largest sum = `6`.

Input: `[1,2,-1,2,3,-2]`

Output: `7`

Explanation: `[1,2,2,3]` has the largest sum = `7`.

Input: `[-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

Output: `0`

Explanation: Sum must always be positive.

## Note

- The input array may contain both positive and negative numbers.
- The subarray with the largest sum may or may not be at the beginning or end of the input array.
- If all the numbers in the input array are negative, the function should return 0.
