# Strings

A string is a sequence of characters in a programming language. It can be used to represent text or any other data that can be expressed as characters.

Here are some common operations that can be performed on strings:

- Concatenation
- Length
- Substring extraction
- Searching for a substring
- Replacing a substring
- Splitting a string
- Sorting a string

This repository contains my solutions to array-related challenges from the book "Daily Coding Problem" by Alex Miller and Lawrence Wu. The solutions are implemented in Python.
